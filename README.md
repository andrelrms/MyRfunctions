# Overview

Personal package with functions that I always find my self having to use. I decided to make a package to avoid having cluttered code.
Feel free to use it.

# Installation

``` r
# install
install.packages('devtools') # if you don't already have it.
devtools::install_github("andrelrms/MyRfunctions")

# load
library(MyRfunctions)
```
